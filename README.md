## 🧭 Introduction

Welcome to the **Docker Workshop**, a structured learning journey designed to help you understand Docker from the ground up.

In this workshop, you’ll learn how Docker works, why it exists, and how to build, run, and manage containerized applications effectively.  
Each section builds on the previous one — combining theory with practical understanding.

This repository contains all the structured modules, detailed explanations, and references for every topic included in the curriculum.
